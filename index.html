<div class="comments">
<p>The graph being drawn is queue length (y axis) against time (x axis).</p>
<p>In this example, I have used a base value of 2 calls per hour (distributed via poisson process), and a call response time of half an hour. The simulation stops after 24 simulation hours, and some extra results are posted to the console (f12).</p>
<p>All of the variables for the simulation can be accessed and changed in the main.js source code.</p>

<h2>Making the Simulation</h2>
<ul>
<li>Programmed using ProcessingJS, a JavaScript library which makes it easier to create a visual display.</li>
<li>Data generated via a poisson process.</li>
<li>Most of the variable components of the simulation can be edited via variables within the source file.</li>
<li>The simulation gives data such as incoming call times, queue lengths at those times, ambulance downtime, waiting times per person, and average waiting time.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Application to Real Life</h2>
<p>The numbers used are unrealistic and arbitrary, but the general correlations can still be applied to real life.</p>
<p>The numbers could be tweaked easily to provide an accurate representation of a specific location.</p>

<h2>The Optimal Case</h2>
<p>What would be the best case scenario for the emergency services?</p>
<p>Reduce downtime; reduce average waiting time.</p>
<p>Note that all of the numbers in these simulations are arbitrary and unrealistic - they only simulate what the queue trend might be like.</p>

<h2>Collecting Data</h2>
<p>I ran the simulation about 50 times, and collected the data on an <a href ="./data.xlsx">excel document</a>.</p>
<p>The simulation was run using similar settings as the settings above - an average of 2 calls per hour, and a response time of half an hour.</p>
<p>I allowed the program to run for 24 simulation hours. The number of incoming calls ranged from 45 to 49, via the poisson process.</p>
<p>I collected some overall results about average waiting time and downtime from this data collection period.</p>

	</figure>
</div>

<h2>Downtime</h2>
<p>As there are only (on average) 2 calls per hour, and a response time of half an hour, the simulation should theoretically be able to handle all of these calls without generating queue length.</p>
<p>This obviously isn't true however, as some calls might be clumped closer to others (via the poisson process). The reason that a queue would begin might be due to <strong>downtime</strong> of the ambulance.</p>
<p>I measured the total downtime of the ambulance, and viewed what the link would be to the average waiting time per person.</p>
<!--<p>There was a problem with this, as the simulation initially ended after 50 calls had been dealt with. This meant that the downtime had very little to do with the average waiting time for this case.</p>
<p>To prove this, I took the ending time of each simulation and standardized it by subtracting it from a arbitrary value. It returned the same value each time.</p>
<figure>
	<img src="./images/downtime.png" alt="results">
	<figcaption>Standardizing the downtime. The 0.05 disparity between some results is due to program lag.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I tried running the simulation again, but instead of it ending after 50 calls had been dealt with, it ended after 24 simulation hours.</p>
<p>This would allow for the calls to be more realistic, rather than there being no calls after the first 50 had finished.</p>-->
<p>Most of the downtime of the simulation comes from the beginning moments, where the initial call is being waited for.</p>
<p>There is almost never downtime further on in the simulation, as the queue has normally had time by now to rack up, and would be dealt with rather than adding downtime.</p>
<figure>
	<img src="./images/graph3.PNG" alt="results">
	<figcaption>Downtime doesn't seem to have an obvious impact!</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I explored why downtime might not have an obvious impact later. One of the worst cases can have a low downtime, just because it is handling a lot of calls, or perhaps calls clumped closely!</p>

<h2>Call "Clumping"</h2>
<p>As downtime doesn't seem to have a correlation with the average waiting time, the "clumping" of calls seems to be the main problem.</p>
<p>As you can see from the simulations below, when lots of calls come in at once the queue length increases a lot, even though they might all be dealt with in the same time as calls coming in gradually.
<div class="horizontal">
	<figure>
		<img src="./images/simulation3.png" alt="results" width="400px" height="400px">
		<figcaption>It might be hard to see, but when more calls come in at once, the queue length tends to increase. Even if they all get dealt with efficiently, whenever the queue length is high, the average wait time increases a lot.</figcaption>
	</figure>
	
	<figure>
		<img src="./images/simulation4.png" alt="results" width="400px" height="400px">
		<figcaption>Both this and the simulation to the left have the same amount of calls, so why the difference in average waiting time? Likely a difference in the distribution of calls (clumping).</figcaption>
	</figure>
</div>

<h2>Calls Handled</h2>
<p>I initially tried taking the calls handled from each case and seeing what the trend of that would be, in relation to some of the other properties.</p>
<figure>
	<img src="./images/callshandled.PNG" alt="results">
	<figcaption>The calls handled for the first few cases.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As you can see, this value was most of the time 46 for my first few cases.</p>
<p>This is due to most of the cases only ever having time to deal with 46 calls. However, if the downtime was low enough, 47 calls would be able to be handled within the time.</p>

<h2>Calls Incoming</h2>
<p>The number of incoming calls ranged from 45 to 49, via the poisson process. You would expect about 47 on average (2 calls per hour for 24 hours)</p>
<p>The number of calls incoming has a huge impact on the queue length.</p>
<div class="horizontal">
	<figure>
		<img src="./images/lowcallsincoming.png" alt="results" width="400px" height="400px">
		<figcaption>A low amount of calls incoming (45 here; 2 below average) results in a high downtime, and not necessarily a low queue (calls clumped together can still cause a queue).</figcaption>
	</figure>
	
	<figure>
		<img src="./images/highcallsincoming.png" alt="results" width="400px" height="400px">
		<figcaption>A high amount of calls incoming (49 here; 2 above average) results in a hard to deal with queue length, as clumping together of calls is more inevitable.</figcaption>
	</figure>
</div>
<p>This correlation seems obvious, but perhaps not how much one extra call would effect the queue length by (for this particular simulation).</p>
<div class="horizontal">
	<figure>
		<img src="./images/graph1.PNG" alt="results">
		<figcaption>Average waiting time tends to increase a lot for each extra call.</figcaption>
	</figure>
	
	<figure>
		<img src="./images/graph2.PNG" alt="results">
		<figcaption>Downtime tends to decrease a lot for each extra call. The only reason it doesn't reach 0 at the end is that there will always be some downtime at the beginning.</figcaption>
	</figure>
</div>

<h2>Downtime 2</h2>
<p>So why does the downtime not have a direct correlation with average waiting time?</p>
<p>Perhaps due to how calls incoming has a correlation with downtime.</p>
<figure>
	<img src="./images/graph2.PNG" alt="results">
</figure>
<p>Lower downtime could mean more calls incoming (causing more clumping), hence worse queues.</p>
<p>At the same time, a lower downtime could mean a more efficient dealing of calls (due to less clumping), hence better queues.</p>

<h2>Ideas for Future Additions/Experiments</h2>
<ul>
<li>Poisson process for response time.</li>
<li>Multiple ambulances.</li>
<li>Longer simulations, with realistic distribution of calls (e.g: day/night)</li>
</ul>
